# Fuji-Kaze-fan-web
This website is a personal project created as a tribute to Fuji Kaze, a renowned Japanese artist known for his unique musical style and creative expression.

Notably, this was the first website I developed during my early exploration of web development. As such, it may lack visual refinement and advanced features. However, it represents an important milestone in my learning journey and reflects my initial efforts in building functional web content from scratch.

The project serves both as a fan-made dedication and a foundational step in my growth as a developer.
