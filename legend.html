                <h1>Who is fuji kaze ? </h1>
                <p class="description1">Fujii Kaze (藤井 風, born June 14, 1997) is a Japanese singer-songwriter and musician under Universal Sigma.
                    Raised in Satoshō, Okayama in Japan, he began uploading covers to YouTube since the age of 12.
                    He released his first studio album, Help Ever Hurt Never in 2020, which reached number one on the Billboard Japan Hot Albums chart and number two on the Oricon Albums Chart.
                    His second album, Love All Serve All, released in 2022 topped both the Japanese Billboard charts and the Oricon Albums Chart and has since been certified platinum in March 2022[2] by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), beating his debut's gold certification in January 2021.
                    Fujii was the first Asian act in history to debut a song in all 73 available countries and regions of Spotify Daily Viral charts. <br>
                    Fujii released his debut single, "何なんw (WTF LOL)" on November 18,[7] 2019, and his second single, "もうええわ (Mo-Eh-Wa)" on December 24. Each single was re-released digitally with its own extended play, with each EP including cover songs that can only be downloaded on Apple Music.
                    In January 2020, he was named as one of Spotify's Early Noise 2020 Top 10 Breaking Artists.[8] One-man live performances in the form of Nan-Nan Show 2020 were scheduled for April 4 and 26 at Zepp Namba and Zepp Tokyo respectively, but were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[9]
                    Fujii released his first studio album Help Ever Hurt Never on May 20, 2020, and reached number one on the Billboard Japan Hot Albums chart. He also announced his first national hall tour, which consists of 12 performances in 11 cities from December 25, 2020, to January 31, 2021.</p>
